# Generative-Modeling-for-Skin-Lesion-Synthesis
Developed a VQ-VAE to learn quantized latent representations &amp; trained an Auto-Regressive Model to generate realistic skin lesion images from the ISIC dataset. Utilized advanced pre-processing techniques &amp; WandB for tracking, visualization, &amp; evaluating generative performance.
